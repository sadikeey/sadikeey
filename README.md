### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### About me
I'm [Sadik Saifi](https://github.com/sadikeey) who is 21-year-old studying [Bachelor of Computer Applications](https://www.shiksha.com/it-software/articles/all-you-need-to-know-about-bca-and-its-scope-blogId-13258) at [Graphic Era University](https://www.geu.ac.in/) in [Dehradun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehradun). I'm quite enthusiastic about programming and a curious person about new technologies and ideas. I am always open to collabrate on projects and new innovative/disruptive ideas.
